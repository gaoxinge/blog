下面我们研究一下python的风格规范。

## Python Enhancement Proposal

这就是我们熟悉的[PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps)。

### PEP 0

[PEP 0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps)，即Index of Python Enhancement Proposals，为PEP的目录。

### PEP 7

[PEP  7](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007)，即CPython的c代码风格规范。

### PEP 8

[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008)，即python的代码风格规范，具体可参见

### PEP 20

[PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020)，即著名的python之禅。

```python
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Google开源项目风格指南

[Google Style Guide](http://zh-google-styleguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/#)是Googel为一些语言定制的风格规范，比如python。
